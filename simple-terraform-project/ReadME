# simple-terraform-project


steps
1. Create an S3 Bucket: Start by creating an S3 bucket to store your website files. The bucket name should be globally unique across all AWS accounts.
2. Configure Bucket for Static Website Hosting: In the S3 bucket properties, enable static website hosting and specify the default index document (e.g., "index.html") and optional error document (e.g., "error.html").
3. Upload Website Files: Upload your static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) to the S3 bucket. Make sure to set appropriate permissions (e.., "public-read" for the objects to make them publicly accessible.
4. Enable Public Access: Allow public access to the S3 bucket and its objects by configuring the
bucket policy or Access Control Lists (ACLs).
5. Configure DNS (Optional): If you want to use a custom domain for your website (e.g., www.yourdomain.com), you can set up a DNS record using Route 53 or any other DNS provider. This step is optional if you are using the default S3 website endpoint.
6. Testing the Website: Once the setup is done, you can test your static website by accessing it through the S3 bucket website URL or your custom domain.
